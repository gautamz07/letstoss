            <span>Super Bowl I (1967)</span>
            <span>
              The first Super Bowl, played between the Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, 
              had the opening coin toss decided by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle using a silver dollar. 
              This moment marked the beginning of a tradition for Super Bowl coin tosses.

            <span>Apollo 11 Moon Landing Site</span>
            <span>
              Before NASA's Apollo 11 mission, 
              astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin needed to choose 
              the precise location on the Moon to land their lunar module. 
              They relied on a coin toss to decide between two candidate 
              landing sites.

              2002 Winter Olympics
            </span>
            <span>
              In the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, 
              a coin toss was used to determine the winner of the men's 
              skeleton event after the final race ended in a tie. Jim Shea Jr. 
              won the gold medal as a result of the coin toss.

              Political Primaries
            </span>
            <span>
              In some cases, political primaries or local elections that end 
              in a tie or are too close to call have resorted to coin tosses to determine the winner. 
              For example, in 2016, a coin toss was used in the Democratic 
              Iowa Caucus to allocate delegates between Hillary Clinton 
              and Bernie Sanders.

              in a tie or are too close to call have resorted to coin tosses to determine the winner. 
              For example, in 2016, a coin toss was used in the Democratic

        <p>
          These are just a few examples of famous decisions made by coin tosses. 
          Flipping a coin is valued for its impartiality and simplicity, 
          making it a common choice in situations where fairness is critical.
